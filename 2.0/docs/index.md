# Vapor Documentation

This is the documentation for Vapor, a Web Framework for Swift that works on iOS, macOS, and Ubuntu; and all of the packages that Vapor offers.

Vapor is the most used web framework for Swift. It provides a beautifully expressive and easy to use foundation for your next website or API.


## Getting Started

If this is your first time using Vapor, head to the [Getting Started](getting-started/install-on-macos.md) section to install Swift and create your first app.

## Packages

Vapor is a modular framework built for a modular language. Code is split up into modules which are grouped to form packages. Packages can be added to your project by adding the package's Git url to your `Package.swift` file. Once a package is included, all of its modules will be available to `import`. You can read more about packages and modules in the Swift Package Manager [conceptual overview](https://swift.org/package-manager/).

Below is a list of packages and modules that come with or can be used by Vapor projects. Packages will have a link to their respective GitHub page.
