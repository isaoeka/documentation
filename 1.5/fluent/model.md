# Model

`Model` is the base protocol for any of your application's models, especially those you want to persist.

> `Model` is only available in Vapor, the Fluent equivalent is `Entity`

## Example

Let's create a simple `User` model.

```swift
final class User {
    var name: String

    init(name: String) {
        self.name = name
    }
}
```

The first step to conforming to `Model` is to import Vapor and Fluent.

```swift
import Vapor
import Fluent
```

Then add the conformance to your class.

```swift
final class User: Model {
    ...
}
```

The compiler will inform you that some methods need to be implemented to conform.

### ID

The first required property is an identifier. This property will contain the identifier when the model is fetched from the database. If it is `nil`, it will be set when the model is saved.

```swift
final class User: Model {
    var id: Node?
    ...
}
```

### Node Initializable

The next requirement is a way to create the model from the persisted data. Model uses `NodeInitializable` to achieve this.

```swift
final class User: Model {
    init(node: Node, in context: Context) throws {
        id = try node.extract("id")
        name = try node.extract("name")
    }
    ...
}
```

The keys `id` and `name` are what we expect the columns or fields in the database to be named. The `extract` call is marked with a `try` because it will throw an error if the value is not present or is the wrong type.

### Node Representable

Now that we have covered initializing the model, we need to show how to save it back into the database. Model uses `NodeRepresentable` to achieve this.

```swift
final class User: Model {
    func makeNode(context: Context) throws -> Node {
        return try Node(node: [
            "id": id,
            "name": name
        ])
    }
    ...
}
```

When a `User` is saved, the `makeNode()` method will be called and the resulting `Node` will be saved to the database. The keys `id` and `name` are what we expect the columns or fields in the database to be named.

> In most of the cases you do not need to be concerned about `context` argument of the `makeNode(context:)` method. Itâ€™s a part of the protocol that allows extensibility in more advanced or specific scenarios.

## Preparations

Some databases, like MySQL, need to be prepared for a new schema. In MySQL, this means creating a new table. Preparations are also equatable to migrations, as they can be used to alter schemas after they've already been created.

### Prepare

Let's assume we are using a SQL database. To prepare the database for our `User` class, we need to create a table. If you are using a database like Mongo, you can leave this method unimplemented.

```swift
final class User {
    static func prepare(_ database: Database) throws {
        try database.create("users") { users in
            users.id()
            users.string("name")
        }
    }
    ...
}
```

Here we create a table named `users` that has an identifier field and a string field with the key `name`. This matches both our `init(node: Node)` and `makeNode() -> Node` methods.

### Revert

An optional preparation reversion can be created. This will be run if `vapor run prepare --revert` is called.

```swift
final class User {
    static func revert(_ database: Database) throws {
        try database.delete("users")
    }
    ...
}
```

Here we are deleting the table named `users`.

### Preparations as Migrations

If you want to add a field to your table after you've already created the initial schema, you can create a struct or class that conforms to `Preparation` like so:

```swift

struct AddFooToBar: Preparation {
    static func prepare(_ database: Database) throws {
        try database.modify("bars", closure: { bar in
            bar.string("foo", length: 150, optional: false, unique: false, default: nil)
        })
    }

    static func revert(_ database: Database) throws {

    }
}
```

Then, in your Droplet setup, add this line: `drop.preparations.append(AddFooToBar.self)`

### Droplet

To run these prepations when the applications boots, you must add the Model to the `Droplet`.

```swift
let drop = Droplet()

drop.preparations.append(User.self)
```

> Note: Preparations must be appended before the Droplet is run.

## Full Model

This is what our final `User` model looks like:

```swift
import Vapor
import Fluent

final class User: Model {
    var id: Node?
    var name: String

    init(name: String) {
        self.name = name
    }


    init(node: Node, in context: Context) throws {
        id = try node.extract("id")
        name = try node.extract("name")
    }

    func makeNode(context: Context) throws -> Node {
        return try Node(node: [
            "id": id,
            "name": name
        ])
    }

    static func prepare(_ database: Database) throws {
        try database.create("users") { users in
            users.id()
            users.string("name")
        }
    }

    static func revert(_ database: Database) throws {
        try database.delete("users")
    }
}
```

## Interacting

Now that `User` conforms to `Model`, it has a plethora of new methods like `find()`, `query()`, `makeJSON()` and more.

### Fetch

Models can be fetched by their database identifier.

```swift
let user = try User.find(42)
```

### Save

Newly created models can be saved to the database.

```swift
var user = User(name: "Vapor")
try user.save()
print(user.id) // prints the new id
```

### Delete

Persisted models with identifiers can be deleted.

```swift
try user.delete()
```

## Model vs. Entity

Model has a couple of extra conformances that a pure Fluent entity doesn't have.

```swift
public protocol Model: Entity, JSONRepresentable, StringInitializable, ResponseRepresentable {}
```

As can be seen in the protocol, Vapor models can automatically convert to `JSON`, `Response`, and even be used in type-safe routing.

## Options

Change the table/collection name
```swift
static var entity = "new_name"
```
