# Install Swift 3: macOS

To use Swift 3 on macOS, you just need to have Xcode 8 installed.

## Install Xcode

Install [Xcode 8](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) from the Mac App Store.

### Open Xcode

After Xcode 8 has been downloaded, you must open it to finish the installation. This may take a while.

```sh
curl -sL check.vapor.sh | bash
```
